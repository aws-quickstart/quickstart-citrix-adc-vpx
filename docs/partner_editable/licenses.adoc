You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, will affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using. Prices are subject to change.

*Tip* After you deploy the Quick Start, we recommend that you enable the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-gettingstarted-turnonreports.html[AWS Cost and Usage Report] to track costs associated with the Quick Start. This report delivers billing metrics to an S3 bucket in your account. It provides cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For more information about the report, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-costusage.html[AWS documentation].

You can choose an AMI based on the licensing model, throughput, and bundling options.

* License model: Pay as You Go (PAYG, for the production licenses) or Bring Your Own License (BYOL, for the Customer Licensed AMI)
* Throughput: 10 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, 3 Gbps, or 5 Gbps
