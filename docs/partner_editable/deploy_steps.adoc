=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options] earlier in this guide.

. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-short-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For other choices, see link:#_supported_regions[Supported Regions] earlier in this guide.
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section of this guide. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
