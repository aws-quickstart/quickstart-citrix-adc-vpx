== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* The vserver (`sample_lb_vserver`) is showing as *down*.

*A.* This might be because no backend servers have been deployed. We recommend configuring service and service groups and binding them with the load-balancing virtual servers (LB vservers). For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/load-balancing/load-balancing-manage-large-scale-deployment/configure-service-groups.html[Configure service groups].

*Q.* While testing in my environment, the backend servers in the remote Availability Zone show as *down*.

*A.* Try one of the following options:

* Add a static route to the remote Availability Zone server subnet by specifying the subnet IP address (SNIP) as the next hop. For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/networking/ip-routing/configuring-static-routes.html[Configuring static routes].
* Change the subnet mask so that subnets in both Availability Zones are accommodated.
