|https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[Regions] |Citrix ADC VPX isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://github.com/citrix/citrix-adc-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/templates/README.md[Citrix Products on AWS Marketplace] page on GitHub.
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Key pair] a|
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the Region where you plan to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[instructions in the AWS documentation].

For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one that’s already being used by a production instance.

To deploy the Quick Start, you must log in to the IAM permissions for the resources and actions the templates will deploy. The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions.

If you want to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users, you need to create an IAM user account. The IAM role must have the permissions for the following actions:

ec2: DescribeInstances

ec2: DescribeNetworkInterfaces

ec2: DetachNetworkInterface

ec2: AttachNetworkInterface

ec2: StartInstances

ec2: StopInstances

ec2: RebootInstances

ec2: DescribeAddresses

ec2: AssociateAddress

ec2: DisassociateAddress

iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy

iam:GetRole
