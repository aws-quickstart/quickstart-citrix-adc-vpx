We refer to the instances in this deployment as *primary* and *secondary*. Each instance has different IP addresses associated with it. When the Quick Start has been deployed successfully, traffic goes through the primary Citrix ADC VPX instance configured in Availability Zone 1. During failover conditions, when the primary instance does not respond to client requests, the secondary ADC VPX instance takes over.

The Elastic IP address of the virtual IP address of the primary instance migrates to the secondary instance, which takes over as the new primary instance.

In the failover process, Citrix ADC VPX does the following:

1.  Checks the virtual servers that have IPSets attached to them.

1.  Finds the IP address that has an associated public IP address from the two IP addresses that the vserver is listening on. One that is directly attached to the vserver, and one that is attached through the IP set.
2.  Re-associates the public Elastic IP address to the private IP address that belongs to the new primary virtual IP address.

To test the deployment, connect to the primary instance and trigger Force Failover. Then check whether the secondary instance takes over.

=== Connect to Citrix HA pair using bastion host

As you cannot access the Citrix ADC VPX instance from outside the VPC, you must use a Linux bastion host to connect to it.

1.  In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console], choose the master stack, and on the *Outputs* tab, find the value of *LinuxBastionHostEIP1*.

1.  *PrivateManagementPrivateNSIP* and *PrimaryADCInstanceID* key’s value to be used in the later steps to SSH into the ADC.

Figure 6: Citrix ADC VPX HA pair deployment resources

1.  Choose *Services*.
2.  On the *Compute* tab, select *EC2*.
+
Under *Resources*, choose *Running Instances*.
+
On the *Description* tab of the primary ADC VPX instance, note the *IPv4 public IP* address. You will need that IP address to construct the SSH command.

1.  To store the key in your keychain, run the command ssh-add -K <your-key-pair>.pem
+
On Linux, you might need to omit the -K flag.
2.  Log in to the bastion host using the following command, using the value for *LinuxBastionHostEIP1* that you noted in step 1.

ssh -A ubuntu@<LinuxBastionHostEIP1>

1.  From the bastion host, you can connect to the primary ADC VPX instance by using SSH.

ssh nsroot@<Primary Management Private NSIP>

Password: <Primary ADC Instance ID>

Figure 9: Connecting to the primary Citrix ADC VPX instance

Now you are connected to the primary Citrix ADC VPX instance. To see the available commands, you can run the help command. To view the current HA configuration, you can run the show HA node command.

1.  To test failover, run the force ha failover command.
+
When prompted to proceed for failover, press Y and then press Enter to initiate the failover condition.

Upon failover, the Master State of the primary instance changes to secondary. The status of the instances can be observed by running the show HA node command:

Figure 11: Master state changes to secondary

In *the Amazon EC2 console*, it can be observed that after failover, the Elastic IP address assigned to the primary ADC VPX instance gets allocated to the secondary instance.
