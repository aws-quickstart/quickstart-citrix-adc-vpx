=== FAQ

*Q.* The vserver (`sample_lb_vserver`) is showing as *down*.

*A.* This might be because no backend servers have been deployed. We recommend configuring service and service groups and binding them with the load-balancing virtual servers (LB vservers). For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/load-balancing/load-balancing-manage-large-scale-deployment/configure-service-groups.html[Configure service groups^].

*Q.* While testing in my environment, the backend servers in the remote Availability Zone show as *down*.

*A.* Try one of the following options:

* Add a static route to the remote Availability Zone server subnet by specifying the subnet IP address (SNIP) as the next hop. For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/networking/ip-routing/configuring-static-routes.html[Configuring static routes^].
* Change the subnet mask so that subnets in both Availability Zones are accommodated.
