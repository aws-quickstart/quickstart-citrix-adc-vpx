.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* Three *security groups*, one for each network interface (Management, Client, Server), that act as virtual firewalls to control the traffic for their associated instances.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, a network interface with a private IP address for the Management (NSIP) and a network interface with a private IP address for the back-end Server subnet (SNIP).
* An AWS Lambda function to handle Citrix ADC VPX high availability and load balancing configuration.
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.
